  //   'Security tokens are digital representations of ownership of assets (e.g., gold, real estate) or economic rights (e.g., a share of profits or revenue).

Some common assets examples of assets that have been tokenized into NFTs include intellectual property rights, artwork, and collectibles. For example, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet was sold as an NFT for USD 2.9 million.',
  // faq_general_answer6_7: '4. Utility Tokens',
  // faq_general_answer6_8:
  //   'Utility tokens are not considered an investment and are not usually traded. These are typically user tokens or in-app coins, which can be used in exchange for platform services.',
  // faq_general_question7:
  //   'What is the difference between a security token and an STO?',
  // faq_general_answer7:
  //   'Security tokens are a type of token, and are regulated as securities in Hong Kong by the SFC. Meanwhile, STOs are an offering of security tokens to qualified investors.',
  // faq_general_question8: 'Are STOs the same as ICOs?',
  // faq_general_answer8:
  //   'ICOs, or initial coin offerings, are offerings of tokens, some of which may be security tokens. As such, some ICOs of security tokens may not comply with relevant securities rules and regulations and could constitute an illegal offering in those jurisdictions. An STO is an offering of security tokens, which are regulated vendor with relevant securities rules and regulations. In an STO, investors invest in security tokens recorded on a blockchain.',
  // faq_general_question9: 'How do STOs reduce time and monetary costs?',
  // faq_general_answer9:
  //   'An STO provides a regulated means of fundraising for companies that do not meet stock exchange listing requirements or would like to avoid the time and costs of a long listing process on stock exchanges. The processes involved in an STO are relatively simpler compared to an IPO. STOs usually take a shorter time to launch to the market.',

  // faq_title3: 'Blockchain 101',
  // faq_general_question10: 'What is the blockchain?',
  // faq_general_answer10:
  //   'Blockchain is a database technology that enables secured data synchronization across multiple parties in trust-less and decentralized environments. By leveraging different types of Blockchains (i.e., public, permissioned, private, hybrid etc.), blockchain participants can facilitate collaboration and transactions within B2B or P2P ecosystems. Major use cases include fundraising (e.g., ICOs, IEOs and STOs), supply chain traceability and cross-border payments.',
  // faq_general_question11: 'What is a “smart contract?”',
  // faq_general_answer11:
  //   'According to global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, smart contracts are “self-executing transactions, written in computer code and performed in an automated way”. The smart contracts lay down the execution logic and predetermined actions, and these are automatically executed when the codes are triggered.',
  // faq_general_question12:
  //   'What is the difference between public vs. permissioned blockchain?',
  // faq_general_answer12:
  //   'Public blockchains allow any party to join the ecosystem. They aim to facilitate decentralization in trust-less environments. Commonly used in fundraising and P2P payments, public networks are often constrained by issues of decentralization, security, and scalability because of the need for mining (consensus mechanism). Public blockchain examples include Bitcoin Blockchain and Ethereum.',
  // faq_general_answer12_1:
  //   'Permissioned or Consortium Blockchains allow only verified users to join the ecosystem. They aim to facilitate real-time, secured, B2B data synchronization. Onboarding processes are needed for parties to obtain digital signatures to join the platform. Without the need for mining, the performance and throughput of permissioned networks are usually much higher. This kind of technology is usually used in corporate solutions; use cases include trade finance, bancassurance and Know Your Client (KYC). Permissioned Blockchain examples include Hyperledger Fabric and Corda R3.',

  //   'Blockchain or the Distributed Ledger Technology open up new opportunities in various scenarios. It facilitates collaboration and partnerships within different ecosystems.',
  // faq_general_answer13_1:
  //   'Outside of crypto-assets and fund raising, the top use case of blockchain is in trade finance.',
  // faq_general_answer13_2:
  //   'Traditionally, banks do not provide supply chain financing to SMEs as they are unable to verify whether their clients’ collateral has previously been used as collateral with other banks. This leads to the duplicate financing problem, as banks may unknowingly provide financing services to clients against collateral that is already leveraged. However, by utlising cryptographic elements of the blockchain, banks can be more confident in dealing with a new range of clients. Examples of trade finance blockchain projects include eTradeconnect in Hong Kong and We.trade in Europe.',
